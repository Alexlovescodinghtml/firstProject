<h1>Paragraph Practice</h1>

<p>	This is a paragraph on my favorite game Doom. Doom is about a guy whos only job is to save humanity from demons.
Im pretty sure everyone knows the saying "right to bear arms" this man takes advantage of that saying. He will rip and tear
through their flesh piece by piece. Litterally the only thing they fear is him. Also the soundtrack is such a good soundtrack with songs like
E1M1 (at dooms gate), the only thing they fear is you, and rip and tear. this concludes this paragraph</p>
